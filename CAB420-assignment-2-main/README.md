# CAB420 Assignment 2
## RGBD Crowd Counting

### Utillisiing monocular vision depth-map generating models to augment image analysis.


#### Three methods are used:

Use a crowd counting model with just color channels
Use a crowd counting model with color and depth channels
Use a crowd counting model + depth channel from pre-trained regression model (monocular depth-map predictor, fine-tuned to use here)
